## IBM Tutorial

### Exploring the Dataset:

Before creating the dashboard, the tutorial begins by exploring the IBM HR dataset. The dataset contains both continuous and categorical variables, providing a rich source of information for analysis.

1. Importing Data:
The next step involves importing the dataset into Power BI. This is done by clicking on "Get Data" and selecting the appropriate file format (CSV in this case).

2. Creating Visualizations:
The tutorial demonstrates how to create various visualizations using the imported dataset. Each visualization represents different aspects of employee data, such as hourly rate, age, education field, job role, department, marital status, and business travel.

3. Formatting Visualizations:
After creating the initial visualizations, the tutorial focuses on formatting them for clarity and aesthetics. This includes adding titles, formatting axes, adjusting grid lines, and customizing borders.

4. Interactivity:
The final step involves ensuring interactivity within the dashboard. Users can select different fields to view corresponding data values, making the dashboard dynamic and user-friendly.
